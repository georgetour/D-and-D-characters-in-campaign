# Dungeons-and-Dragons-characters-in-campaign

This is my final capstone project for Responsive Web Design Specialization for University of London.

It's built with **meteor.js** so if you want to run it you must have meteor installed on your system. Install from here https://www.meteor.com/install.

Me and my friends are playing dungeons and dragons and I thought about this app so we can have live preview of characters in campaign
with info about each character .


<h2>What this app does?</h2>
Users are able to see what characters are playing in their session and easily update items, skills, levels etc from their tablet, phone or pc.
   
   
<h3>What is Dungeons and Dragons?</h3>

Dungeons and Dragons is a pen and paper RPG that played by all ages for years around the world since it sharps your mind
and imagination to great levels .It's really fun and you can pass your time with your friends by playing it amazingly.
